Names Are Hard Training App for Cycling

TrainerRoad and Kudo Coach are designed for racing. We are going to start off targeting Randonneuring and Touring. In the future we may do more with racing.

You might also want to be in control of your data. I also have no idea what TrainerRoad does with your data, so maybe this is better from a privacy perspective.

TR and KC also don't allow you to make modifications to the algorithms like you can with us. Please submit your training modifications and we will try to figure out a system for allowing others to select different training options.

If anyone feels strongly about using something other than the Apache license, then I'm happy to discuss. I feel like someone like Kudo Coach or TrainerRoad using the source is more important for actually having a piece of software people care about than making sure those companies are giving back to the community. We'll see how it goes.
