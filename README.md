Names Are Hard Training App for Cycling

TrainerRoad isn't that expensive, but I'm more of a mileage guy than a power meter guy. I know TrainerRoad has a lot of science. It's certainly better, but I need to learn Java anyway. I also have no idea what TrainerRoad does with your data, so maybe this is better from a privacy perspective.

At the moment, the assumption is that you are going to be running this on localhost or that you simply don't care. There isn't going to be a lot of thought given to security. 

Please feel free to submit pull requests on security things (or anything else).

That said, I have no real intention of being a long-term project maintainer. If someone thinks this is a good longterm idea and wants to talk about a better place for this, then happy to discuss.

If anyone feels strongly about using something other than the Apache license, then I'm happy to discuss. I feel like someone like Kudo Coach or TrainerRoad using the source is more important for actually having a piece of software people care about than making sure those companies are giving back to the community. We'll see how it goes.
